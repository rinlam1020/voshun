DIYTHEMES SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (Updated December 3, 2015)

---:[ Summary for Normal People ]:---

Pretty much anything is easier to read than a legal document, so we’ve provided an executive summary of the Thesis 2 Software License Agreement that a normal person can actually understand. Once you provide payment, we grant you license to use the Thesis 2 software under the following conditions:

* The license provides you, and only you, with the rights to use the software for its intended purpose.
* You may allow a third party to work on Thesis for you, but remember—you’re the one with the license, so if they mess with the software and screw it up, you are still responsible.
* The term of the agreement will vary depending on the option you choose: Thesis Professional, Thesis Basic, Thesis Basic Plus, and licenses that are grandfathered in. See Section 2 below for specifics.
* You can’t sell, rent, or otherwise transfer the software to anyone else.
* You can’t distribute the software or bundle it with other products or offers.
* Other than for educational purposes, any modification of the Thesis “core” is prohibited.
* You cannot change or add to the program and then sue us because it’s not working correctly.
* You may create Extensions (Skins or Boxes) and license them however you choose, provided you are not violating any pre-existing licenses associated with your Extensions.
* Most Extensions (Skins and Boxes) from DIYthemes carry an MIT open-source license, but from time to time, we may release Extensions under the DIYthemes Software Extensions License Agreement (http://diythemes.com/thesis/rtfm/software-extensions-license-agreement/). It is your responsibility to adhere to the licensing of any Extensions you use.
* If you need support, please visit our Customer Support Center (http://diythemes.com/support/) so our experts can assist you.
* In order to qualify for a refund, you must meet the requirements outlined in the Thesis Refund Policy (http://diythemes.com/thesis-refund-policy/).
* If you need to contact us for a non-support inquiry, please email us at diythemes@gmail.com.
* If you use Thesis with other programs, we can’t be responsible if it doesn’t act properly.
* We reserve the right to post that you are a client of ours.

If there is any conflict between this summary and the agreement below, the agreement will govern.

This summary should prove helpful for understanding the agreement, but if you still have questions, please contact us at diythemes@gmail.com.
